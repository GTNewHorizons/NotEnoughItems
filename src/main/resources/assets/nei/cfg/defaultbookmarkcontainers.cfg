# This file contains a list of GUIs that can use the DefaultBookmarkContainerHandler for bookmarks.
# It serves as an alternative to API.registerBookmarkContainerHandler and is intended for cases
# where you can't modify the mod itself and its GUI doesn't have custom slots.
# Each line in this file should either be a comment (starting with '#') or a guiContainer class name.
# If you delete this file, it will be regenerated with the default bookmark containers list.
