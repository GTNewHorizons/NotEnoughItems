# This version of NEI loads recipes in parallel. Some recipe handlers have not been designed with that in mind and might
# crash. List these handlers in this file to force them to be loaded a single thread. Each line in this file should
# either be a comment (starts with '#') or a fully qualified class name (that includes the package name) for a recipe
# handler.
# If you delete this file, it will be regenerated with the default height hacked handlers list.
