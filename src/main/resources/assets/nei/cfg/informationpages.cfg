# NEI Item Information Config
#
# Each line should be in the format:
# modid:itemname(:meta) = description text
#
# You can repeat the same item on multiple lines to add extra pages.
# Use \n to insert line breaks inside the description. Use it multiple times for a larger gap between lines.
# Use meta 32767 if the item has subtypes and you want the info to apply to all of them.
# Using a translation key for the description will automatically translate it.
# Only the first '=' after the item name is treated as the separator; feel free to put them in your descriptions.
# Spaces before and after '=' are removed from the description and are optional.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Example:
# # Jungle Wood (meta 3)
# minecraft:log:3 = Exotic wood found in tropical climates.
#
# # Stone (two pages of information)
# minecraft:stone = Stone is a block commonly found underground.\n\nIts optimal tool is a pickaxe.
# minecraft:stone = It drops cobblestone unless mined with a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch.
